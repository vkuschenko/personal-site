  <h3 class="bio__greeting">Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

  <p class="bio__text">
    I'm Viktor - a passionate, professional software developer with around 15
    years of experience. I started my career as a QA engineer, confidently
    moving to QA Automation and then to a Developer role. At the moment I'm a
    fullstack developer but mostly focused on the Frontend, UI, and UX. Over the
    years I had a chance to work with a variety of languages, frameworks,
    platforms, and technologies.
  </p>

  <p class="bio__text">
    On my professional journey, I've been involved in the success of many
    companies of different sizes and kinds. Enterprises and startups, product
    companies, and outsourcing are all in my portfolio. As a result, I was lucky
    to gain experience in various fields: big media, sports, fin-tech,
    messengers, and even security, and a little bit in AI.
  </p>

  <p class="bio__text">
    I aim to provide high-quality results, solve problems, and help products
    grow.
  </p>

  <p class:list={["bio__text", "last-paragraph"]}>
    Besides my main job, I used to share my expertise and knowledge as a
    Frontend Development Coach at one of the IT Schools helping newcomers start
    their IT path.
